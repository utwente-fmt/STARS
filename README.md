# STARS tool-chain: Scheduling and Temporal Analysis of Resource-constrained SDF graphs

STARS tool-chain is developed in context of SENSATION project. The primary purpose of STARS tool-chain is to analyse SDF graphs, using the model-checker UPPAAL. In particular, it consists of following steps.

1.	Utilising SDF3 for generating and analysing SDF graphs.
2.	Automatically transforming  SDF3 models to UPPAAL models. 
3.	Utilising UPPAAL for producing traces for SDF graphs on limited resources .
4.	Using Python to parse traces produced by UPPAAL to generate Excel sheets, representing the optimal schedules.

# Installation and Usage

Please refer to STARS_InstructionManual.pdf for instructions on installing and getting started with STARS tool-chain.
