To use one of the transformations
=================================
- Right-click the relevant ant launch file (in the ant subdirectory)
- Select "Run As..." and invoke
- Select the input model to transform
- Output model(s) will be created in the same directory as the input model


To start up the diagram editor
==============================
- Make sure you have all dependant plugin projects installed (sense.diagrm, sense.edit, sense.editor)
- Right-click "plugin.xml", select "Run As..." and invoke as Eclipse Application
- This will start a new Eclipse instance, which has to run in a separate workspace
- Create an empty project (New | Project | General | Project...)
- Within the new project, start up the editor (New | Example... | Sense Diagram)
- Saving the diagram will create a .sense-file that you can transform to SDF3 or Uppaal

Alternatively, to edit an existing .sense-file

- Copy a .sense-file to the project folder (outside Eclipse)
- Refresh the Eclipse project
- Right-click the .sense-file and select "initialize sense_diagram diagram file"
